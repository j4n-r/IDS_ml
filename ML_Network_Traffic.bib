	abstract = {Malicious communication behavior is the network communication behavior generated by malware (bot-net, spyware, etc.) after victim devices are infected. Experienced adversaries often hide malicious information in {HTTP} traffic to evade detection. However, related detection methods have inadequate generalization ability because they are usually based on artificial feature engineering and outmoded datasets. In this paper, we propose an {HTTP}-based Malicious Communication traffic Detection Model ({HMCD}-Model) based on generated adversarial flows and hierarchical traffic features. {HMCD}-Model consists of two parts. The first is a generation algorithm based on {WGAN}-{GP} to generate {HTTP}-based malicious communication traffic for data enhancement. The second is a hybrid neural network based on {CNN} and {LSTM} to extract hierarchical spatial-temporal features of traffic. In addition, we collect and publish a dataset, {HMCT}-2020, which consists of large-scale malicious and benign traffic during three years (2018-2020). Taking the data in {HMCT}-2020(18) as the training set and the data in other datasets as the test set, the experimental results show that the {HMCD}-Model can effectively detect unknown {HTTP}-based malicious communication traffic. It can reach F1 = 98.66\% in the dataset {HMCT}-2020(19-20), F1 = 90.69\% in the public dataset {CIC}-{IDS}-2017, and F1 = 83.66\% in the real traffic, which is 20+\% higher than other representative methods on average. This validates that {HMCD}-Model has the ability to discover unknown {HTTP}-based malicious communication behavior.},
